        # Beginner game for easier teaches, with some simplifications and beginner-friendly rules:
        # - Snake draft, not waterfall, hopefully with relatively-easy-to-grasp private powers
        # - First stock round reverse of draft order, then priority in reverse order of cash holdings to encourage catch-up
        # - Low player count (max 4), with low number of privates and railroads, relatively low train count
        # - Train export until phase D triggered to move along beginners and guarantee train rush
        # - Low token count, but lots geographical constraints, private available to add one additional token
        # - No yellow stock zone, only sell-then-buy to reduce stock shenanigans a bit
